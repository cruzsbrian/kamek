# Wonky Kong

Wonky Kong is an Othello engine written in C++.
To build, run make in the root directory.
Running the `wonky_kong` executable opens an interactive session in the console.
At the prompt you can enter the following commands:
- a move in letter-number format
- `go` for the engine to move
- `undo` to revert the last move.

Run `wonky_kong -h` for a full list of options.

## Implementation

The engine uses the alpha-beta search algorithm with ProbCut, aspiration windows, iterative deepening, and a transposition table.

Board positions are evaluated using a logistic regression on patterns of pieces in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.

Wonky Kong tracks the time spent on each search to dynamically budget its time for each move.
When it estimates that the game can be fully solved in the time remaining, it switches to a win-loss-draw endgame solver.

Wonky Kong uses an opening book to play the first several moves, which is generated by deep searches with the midgame search engine.
Book generation follows strong lines of play farther than weak lines, based on its min-max score for the opponent's move.
